This project involves the implementation of graph and tree data structures in Java, avoiding the use of standard data structures like arrays or lists by relying on pointers instead. 
Additionally, it incorporates search algorithms BFS and DFS using SCC.

This project showcases the ability to create complex data structures and algorithms from scratch while utilizing pointers in Java.
It also demonstrates an understanding of fundamental graph theory concepts such as SCC and search algorithms. 
Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for further exploration of graph theory and related topics.
